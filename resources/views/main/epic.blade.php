                            The sixth man in basketball is a player who is not a starter, but comes off the bench much more
                            often than other reserves, and often is the first plater to be substituted in the game. The presence
                            of a good sixth man is often a sign of a team excellence. These team members also act as leaders and step up beyond their position
                            requirements to lead their department to excellence.
